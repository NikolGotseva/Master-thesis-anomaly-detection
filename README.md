# Master-thesis-anomaly-detection
This repository contains the source code developed for my Master's thesis on anomaly detection in cellular data. The study utilizes publicly available data: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EGZHFV

The primary focus of the research was the implementation and evaluation of a Transformer-based model for anomaly detection, inspired by the architecture proposed in the following paper: https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/3/152

To assess the effectiveness of the Transformer model, it was benchmarked against several established anomaly detection methods, including: LSTM Autoencoder, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), Interquartile Range (IQR) method, Z-score-based detection.
